# Numbers
The best solution to "magic numbers"

## Step 1
import library by downloading `Numbers.java` and putting it in the src folder of your project

## Step 2
use the library by calling `Numbers.#`, where # is the english name of any number from zero to one thousand written in camelCase\
Ex. `Numbers.one` = 1, `Numbers.oneHundredThirtySeven` = 137, `Numbers.sevenHundredEleven` = 711
